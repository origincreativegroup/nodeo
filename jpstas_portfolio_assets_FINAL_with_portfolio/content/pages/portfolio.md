### Caribbean Pools Brand Evolution
*Over more than a decade, I guided Caribbean Pools through a complete brand evolution—modernizing its identity, creating unified design systems across print, apparel, fleet, and digital, and aligning the company’s creative output with its operational growth. The brand system I built became the foundation for every visual and communication channel, scaling with the company as it grew from $7M to $17M in annual revenue.*

### Customer Experience Systems
*Between 2016 and 2025, I helped design and implement every major customer-facing system at Caribbean Pools—from the first Mailchimp email list to a fully integrated CRM platform that connects marketing, operations, and service. By transforming paper processes, centralizing communication, and defining the structure for customer care, I helped the company deliver a faster, smarter, and more consistent experience across every touchpoint.*

### In-House Print Studio Build
*Between 2017 and 2025, I designed, built, and managed Caribbean Pools’ in-house print and apparel studio—transforming creative operations from outsourced chaos into a fully self-sufficient production pipeline. The studio produced everything from fleet wraps and signage to apparel and promotional materials, saving six figures annually while giving the company full creative control over its brand.*

### Caribbean Pools Media Campaigns
*From 2017 to 2025, I led all visual media creation at Caribbean Pools—concepting, shooting, editing, and distributing photo, video, and digital graphics that redefined how the company presented itself. By building an in-house media ecosystem capable of handling everything from cinematic drone work to animated social content, I turned marketing into a repeatable production engine that drove engagement, sales, and brand trust.*

### CaribbeanPools.com Redesign & Digital Platform Evolution
*I led Caribbean Pools’ digital evolution—building its first e-commerce platform, ShopCaribbeanPools.com, and later redesigning CaribbeanPools.com in 2025 to unify both into a cohesive customer experience. The overhaul modernized UX, clarified the service journey, and turned the company’s websites into active revenue engines instead of static brochures.*
