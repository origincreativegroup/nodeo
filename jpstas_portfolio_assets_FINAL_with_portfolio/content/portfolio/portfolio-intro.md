# Portfolio Overview — Brand Designer & Creative Technologist  

From 2014 to 2025, I helped transform Caribbean Pools & Spas from a family-run service company into a modern, fully integrated brand and customer experience.  
Over twelve years, I built the systems—visual, digital, and operational—that connected the company’s identity to its performance.  

I designed the brand’s visual language, engineered an in-house print studio, created its digital platforms, and implemented automation systems that made the business faster and more consistent. My work spanned design, marketing, technology, and operations—bridging creative thinking with real-world execution.  

Each case study in this portfolio represents a different layer of that transformation:  
- **Brand Evolution** — defining a scalable identity system that unified every visual touchpoint.  
- **In-House Print Studio** — building a full production pipeline to bring creative control in-house.  
- **Website Redesign & Digital Platform Evolution** — modernizing the company’s digital footprint and e-commerce presence.  
- **Media Campaigns** — capturing, designing, and distributing content that told the brand’s story across every channel.  
- **Customer Experience Systems** — integrating CRM, automation, and communication tools to create a connected customer journey.  

Together, these projects show how I think about design: not as decoration, but as infrastructure.  
When design, technology, and process align, brands don’t just look better—they work better.
