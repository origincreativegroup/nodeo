# Customer Experience Systems  

**Role:** Creative Technologist · Process Designer · CX Strategist  
**Summary:** Between 2016 and 2025, I helped design and implement every major customer-facing system at Caribbean Pools—from the first Mailchimp email list to a fully integrated CRM platform that connects marketing, operations, and service. By transforming paper processes, centralizing communication, and defining the structure for customer care, I helped the company deliver a faster, smarter, and more consistent experience across every touchpoint.

## Content  
When I started managing Caribbean Pools’ communications in 2016, the company had hundreds of customers, dozens of technicians, and zero automation. Every call, form, and email was manual.  

Over the next nine years, I worked with leadership, admin, and field teams to design and implement a connected **Customer Experience System**—a framework that streamlined how we communicate, collect information, and serve customers.  

This transformation happened step by step, starting with Mailchimp and ending with a fully integrated CRM. Each phase solved a specific problem while building toward a unified customer experience.

## Challenge  
The company’s communication flow was fragmented.  
- Technicians filled out paper forms that took days to process.  
- The admin team had to manually update customers and invoice completed jobs.  
- Retail stores and service departments had no shared system for online orders or scheduling.  
- Customer calls overwhelmed staff every spring, leading to long hold times and misrouted inquiries.  

We needed a connected workflow that united marketing, retail, service, and operations without slowing down the business.

## Solution  

### 1) Establishing Digital Communication (2016–2017)  
I introduced **Mailchimp** as a dedicated platform for updates, promotions, and newsletters. Then I implemented **Formstack** to digitize paper-heavy workflows—moving more than 100 field technicians from daily paper forms to digital submissions.  
- Admin could view job data instantly, invoice completed jobs, and trigger follow-ups.  
- I designed each form to match technician workflows while giving the admin team structured data.

### 2) Launching Online Customer Access (2019–2021)  
I built **ShopCaribbeanPools.com** so local customers could schedule service and buy pool chemicals online.  
- Chemical purchases routed to the nearest retail store.  
- Service requests routed to our new **Customer Care Team**, whose processes and procedures I helped define.

### 3) Customer Care Team & MARS Program (2021–2023)  
Worked with leadership to form a dedicated **Customer Care Team** and **MARS** (Maintenance Account Representatives) for weekly pool maintenance customers.  
- Wrote training docs and evaluation criteria to ensure consistent account management and performance.

### 4) IVR Menu Optimization (2023)  
Analyzed call logs and designed a multi-level **IVR** system.  
- Customers reached the right person faster; branded prompts improved clarity.  
- Average handling time dropped **35%**, first-contact resolution improved **40%**.

### 5) CRM Migration: Evosus → Jobber (2024–2025)  
Assisted in selecting and rolling out **Jobber CRM** to match real-world workflows; completed migration before Spring 2025.  
Merged the legacy 2016 **Mailchimp** master list into Jobber-synced audiences—finally enabling fully automated, trigger-based communication tied to service events.

## Results  
- **Speed:** invoicing and customer communications cut from days to hours.  
- **Integration:** all major systems (Formstack, Jobber, Mailchimp, VoIP) now share live data.  
- **Efficiency:** automated 80% of recurring communications.  
- **Call experience:** dropped calls down 60%, smarter routing via IVR.  
- **Scale:** digital processes supported growth to 100+ field techs without adding admin headcount.
