# In-House Print Studio Build  

**Role:** Creative Technologist · Print Production Lead  
**Summary:** Between 2017 and 2025, I designed, built, and managed Caribbean Pools’ in-house print and apparel studio—transforming creative operations from outsourced chaos into a fully self-sufficient production pipeline. The studio produced everything from fleet wraps and signage to apparel and promotional materials, saving six figures annually while giving the company full creative control over its brand.

## Content  
Before 2017, every printed asset—truck wraps, window clings, banners, even staff uniforms—was outsourced. Each job required vendor coordination, lengthy turnarounds, and expensive minimums. Brand colors varied by supplier, lead times dragged into weeks, and seasonal promotions often missed their window.  

I proposed a simple idea: what if we brought printing in-house?  

I handled everything—research, purchasing, installation, and process design. Within months, we had converted an unused storeroom into a full-scale production space equipped with an HP Latex 315 printer, Graphtec plotter, and a dedicated apparel production station. What started as a cost-saving experiment evolved into one of the company’s most important creative investments.  

Over eight years, I expanded the operation into a hybrid print and fabrication studio that supported every department—marketing, retail, construction, and service.

## Challenge  
The problems went far beyond cost.  
- Outsourced work meant we couldn’t prototype ideas quickly.  
- Inconsistent vendor files caused color shifts and logo distortions.  
- Long lead times delayed new branding rollouts.  
- We had no control over quality or scheduling.  

We needed to replace a fragmented, vendor-dependent process with a fast, accurate, and scalable in-house system that could handle daily demand.

## Solution  
I approached the build like an engineering project: identify bottlenecks, design workflows, and prototype every step before scaling.  

### 1) Equipment & Layout Design  
I selected the HP Latex 315 for its eco-friendly inks and material flexibility, then paired it with a Graphtec cutting plotter for precision contour cuts. I designed the floor plan for efficient flow—intake → print → cure → cut → finish—with safety and ergonomics in mind.  

### 2) Production Workflow & Templates  
- Built standardized templates for fleet graphics, signage, apparel, and marketing collateral.  
- Implemented a consistent color-management system using ICC profiles and Pantone-calibrated vinyl samples.  
- Created digital production checklists and SOPs for printing, cutting, and finishing to ensure repeatability across seasonal staff.  

### 3) Apparel Program Expansion  
Introduced heat-transfer vinyl for uniforms and small-batch apparel runs. Designed uniform layouts for over 120 employees annually—split by department color for quick identification in the field.  

### 4) Training & Knowledge Transfer  
Trained seasonal production assistants on machine operation, finishing techniques, and design file preparation. Developed quick-reference guides so anyone could step into the workflow and produce professional-grade output.  

### 5) Cross-Department Integration  
Integrated the print studio into company operations:
- Marketing used it for event signage and retail displays.  
- Service used it for vehicle decals and instructional placards.  
- Construction used it for safety and compliance labeling.  

The studio became the creative backbone of the company.

## Results  
- **Cost reduction:** saved more than $250,000 in outsourcing within three years.  
- **Speed:** reduced turnaround times from 10–14 days to under 48 hours for most projects.  
- **Consistency:** achieved 100 % brand-accurate color and typography across every output.  
- **Volume:** produced over 100 fleet wraps, 1,000+ banners and decals, and 120+ uniforms annually.  
- **Capability:** enabled on-demand production for marketing, recruiting, and community events without vendor scheduling delays.
